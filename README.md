Website for South Palo Alto Food Closet.  Starting off by implementing the design in my [UI mockup](https://github.com/mleong245/spafc-website-mockup) using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Used Bootstrap to make the design responsive compared to the original mockup.


**\*UPDATE\*** Development on this implementation is currently paused as we are looking into moving away from static pages using pure HTML and CSS toward using frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.  Please see the new repository [here](https://github.com/spafc/spafc.github.io).
